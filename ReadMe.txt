Decription: 	This is the pascal coompiler written in python 2. The Pascal Compiler 
		can compute the some common algorithms in the pascal language, such as sum, division, 
		mutipication, for loop, while loop, repeat loop and switch statement.


List of File: 	PascalCompiler.py
		sum.pas
		Division.pas
		for.pas
		if.pas
		while.pas
		switch.pas
		repeat.pas
				

Runing and Testing:	The PascalCompiler.py need to run it in python 2 enviroment. 
			For example, if we want to run the pascal file "sum.pas" on the
			compiler. 	
			
			In window 10:

			First: 	Openning Command Prompt 

			Second: Going into the File directly
			
			Third: 	Running the command "python pascalCompiler.py sum.pas"
				
			Fourth: Runing the switch statement "python pascalCompiler.py switch.pas"

			*****Fifth:  we can run all the file in the format with command "python pascalCompiler.py [pascal file]"
